# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose/Overview
In this task, I was asked to pull images and titles from various websites and then put these together on my own webpage.  I needed to have the self built website be able to pull data from all other sites at the click of a button.  The new website includes various pictures, a fact table, and a recent news article.

## Deliverable 3
In this deliverable I made the following changes to the code using bootstrap elements:
- I switched the scraping button from large to small
- I made the background of the header section a light gray to contrast it with the rest of the webpage
